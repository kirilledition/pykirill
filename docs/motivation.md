# Why?

This package was created because of two primary reasons.

There are couple functions i use nearly always in my research and i wanted them to be available to me in any environment including colab. So i packed them into easily installable package

I wanted to learn modern practices of python packaging and development workflow, such as:

- CI/CD for tests and code quality
- Auto documentation building

Tools used:
- Github workflows
- Ruff
- Pytest
- Mypy
- Docker
- Mkdocs
