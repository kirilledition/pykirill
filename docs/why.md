# ü§î Why? 

This package was created for two primary reasons:

1. **Accessibility of Common Functions:**
   There are a couple of functions that I use nearly always in my research. I wanted these functions to be available to me in any environment, including Google Colab. By packaging them into an easily installable package, I can ensure they are always at my fingertips, no matter where I'm working.

2. **Learning Modern Python Practices:**
   I wanted to learn and implement modern practices of Python packaging and development workflow. This includes:

   - Setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for tests and code quality.
   - Automating documentation building.

### Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è

To achieve these goals, I used the following tools:

- **GitHub Workflows:** For automating CI/CD processes.
- **Ruff:** For linting and code formatting.
- **Pytest:** For running tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Mypy:** For static type checking.
- **Docker:** For creating consistent development and production environments.
- **MkDocs:** For building and maintaining project documentation.
