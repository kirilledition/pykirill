# üõ†Ô∏è Development

## üîÑ Workflow

This is current development workflow to ensure code quality. In future should be automated with make, tox or nox

```bash
pip install ".[development]"
ruff format --check
ruff format
ruff check
mypy source
pytest .
python -m build --wheel --outdir /Software/Wheels
```

## Adding new features

```bash
git checkout -b feature
```

Change version on pyproject.toml to YYYY.MINOR.PATCH+feature. Use same feature name as branch. Use version name, you checked out from, change version during release process. # Add this rule to versioning section.

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "add new feature"
git push -u origin feature
```

Build whl for testing in local environment

```bash
python -m build --wheel --outdir /Software/Wheels
```

If main brunch got updates and new version, merge changes to your feature branch, change version in pyproject toml accordingly

Introduce typing for new feature functions

Introduce tests for new feature functions

Introduce docstrings for new feature functions

## üóìÔ∏è Versioning

`pykirill` uses a custom versioning scheme designed to provide clear and immediate context about the release timeline and the nature of changes included in each release. My versioning scheme follows the format `YYYY.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- `YYYY` is the current year, indicating the year of the release.
- `MINOR` is the minor version number, incremented for new features and significant changes.
- `PATCH` is the patch version number, incremented for small changes and bug fixes.

### Versioning Rules

**Major Version (`YYYY`):**
The major version corresponds to the current calendar year. This allows users to quickly see when the latest features and improvements were introduced. The major version will change at the beginning of each new year.

**Minor Version:**
The minor version is incremented when:

- New functionality is introduced, enhancing the capabilities of `pykirill`.
- A deprecated option or feature is removed, ensuring the codebase remains clean and up-to-date.

**Patch Version:**
The patch version is incremented for:

- Bug fixes, including behavior changes that resolve issues.
- Small changes that do not introduce new functionality but improve stability or performance.

## üöÄ Releasing

Change version in pyproject.toml
Change version in documentation installation section

```bash
git tag YYYY.MINOR.PATCH
git push origin YYYY.MINOR.PATCH
```

## Code style

Docstrings. Google style with markdown code block in usage. Do not use types in docstrings, use typing instead.

Code style is maintained by ruff with bigger linewidth setting.

You should use namedtuples instead of regular tuples.

Plotting functions should always include ax argument to be compatible with SubplotsManager interface.
